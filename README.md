# Hello!

This is a simple fighting game.
You can create a character and choose his/her class.
Currently there are three classes:
- strength (16 STR, 8 END, 10 AGI)
- endurance (10 STR, 18 END, 8 AGI)
- agility (13 STR, 12 END, 15 AGI)

After defeating an enemy your character receives EXP
Based on the level of that enemy.

When you defeat certain amount of enemies,
you level-up and your stats increase.

But don't worry, your progress won't go anywhere:
You can save/load your characters into 5 available Save Slots.
Yes, only 5 of them. PlayStation Style.

Character classes are stored in characters.csv. Leave it as it is.
If you don't want to download available sample save.csv file with
one Char already saved, that's perfectly fine. On the first run
the game automaticaly creates a blank file and populates it with
empty Save Slots.

Enjoy!
